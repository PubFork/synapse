Boost Synapse is a C++ signal programming library. It can be used to define communication channels between many different entities in a dynamic object environment. Sometimes such libraries are part of a larger API, but independent alternatives like Boost Signals 2 or libsigc++ are available as well.

Complete documentation is available in libs/synapse/doc as well as online at http://zajo.github.io/boost-synapse/.
